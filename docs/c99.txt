These programs are compiled using -std=c99 to compile ISO C programs. However, some examples use POSIX C features. To enable POSIX C features (and other features) in a program compiled with -std=c99, you can do "#define _GNU_SOURCE" at the top of your code. For a full description of what these variables mean, run "man feature_test_macros".
